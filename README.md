# OMNeT-DPoS-Simulation

> [WIP] Simulate DPoS consensus on OMNet++.
> by Lazy guy!

~~THIS IS MAC VERSION!!! BUT HERE IS NOTHING EXCEPY WINDOWS VERSION, I'LL UPDATE IT IN FREE TIME. SO DON'T RUN THIS SIMULATION NOW!!!~~

!!!Purpose for personally research!!! That means this repo just use for test. If you ref it, YOU OWN RISK!!!

Simple simulation for DPoS consensus, errors here, be careful.

## Required

- ~~macOS Catalina 10.15.4 (19E266)~~
- ~~OMNeT++ Version: 5.6.1~~
- Windows 10 x64 2019 Pro
- OMNeT++ 5.2


## Issues

Actually, when you complie the OMNeT++ under the macOS/Linux, it's always shown you same error:

```
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```
Time limitation, fix later... So, we use Windows version here.
