# OMNeT-DPoS-Simulation

> [WIP] Simulate DPoS consensus on OMNet++.

THIS IS MAC VERSION!!! BUT HERE IS NOTHING EXCEPY WINDOWS VERSION, I'LL UPDATE IT IN FREE TIME. SO DON'T RUN THIS SIMULATION NOW!!!

!!!Purpose for personally research!!! That means this repo just use for test. If you ref it, YOU OWN RISK!!!

Simple simulation for DPoS consensus, errors here, be careful.

## Required

- macOS Catalina 10.15.4 (19E266)
- OMNeT++ Version: 5.6.1

## Issues

Actually, when you complie the OMNeT++ under the macOS/Linux, it's always shown you same error:

```
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```
Time limitation, fix later...


## Changelog
